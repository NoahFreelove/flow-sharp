# Flow Language

A Vibecoded music production language.


Called flow-sharp because original implementation was in ansi c and unmaintainable.

Wanted to make it maintainable so I vibecoded the language translation from C to C#.

Then I realized I could have many more features if I kept vibecoding. So I did.

This is the product of it.

Flow-lang is probably not intuitive, but its meant for programmer-musicians.

Its fairly extensible, the builtin instruments don't sound too good. Very old MIDI sounding, but has a nice charm.
