# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** Users can write musical ideas as code and hear them immediately -- the language must faithfully translate musical notation into correct, playable audio.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — language-foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (language-foundations) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-01

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Loops/string interpolation in Phase 1 to unblock iteration patterns for later phases
- [Roadmap]: Beat-synced live reload deferred to Phase 5 (highest risk, needs solid foundation)
- [Roadmap]: Custom oscillators use wavetable approach to avoid per-sample interpreter overhead
- [Phase 01]: Visualization uses 2 cols/beat and # chars for terminal compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Loop control flow uses exception-based BreakSignal/ContinueSignal caught per-loop
- [Phase 01]: Used queue-based multi-token approach in lexer for interpolated strings

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Custom oscillator wavetable size needs profiling (512? 1024? 4096?)
- Phase 4: Chord DSL voice leading algorithm needs music theory research
- Phase 5: Thread-safe section swapping architecture needs spike
